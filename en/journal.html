                For the first meeting with the entire team, we spent our lunch
                period getting to know each other, figuring out who will go to
                the kickoff, and deciding on a theme. We went through many theme
                ideas like Shrek, Elon Musk, and Toy Story, but ultimately we
                chose Area 51 as our theme. We then started to brainstorm kiosk,
                video, and website ideas for this theme. We also went over the
                plan and work schedule for the rest of the year.

                and took the dimensions of the playing field. After that, we

                For the second team meeting, we went over what happened at the
                kickoff for all the members who could not attend. We debated
                potential game strategies, including if it was better or worse
                to be the first one at the hinge board, and robot mechanisms for
                the entire lunch period. After figuring out potential game strategies, we broke off into subteams and designed potential robots. Big topics that each design had to address was which type of wheels and drive system should we use (tank drive, mecanum wheels…), whether we should double up on safety mechanisms, and whether we should deploy a smaller robot to race to the hinge board at the start of the round. While mecanum wheels are better for maneuvering, they are slower than the other options. We also came up with the idea of having backup systems should one fail. For example, the arch actuator could be activated with the robot’s potential arm or the robot’s potential flap. We also came to the conclusion that for the ball and chain actuator, we will be using the fixed shape of the robot’s body and align it so that it is parallel to the ball and chain contraption. After we made our initial designs, each subteam pitched it to the whole team. Then, we swapped teams and made 5 more new designs to push ourselves to think out of the box.

                since we just love working so much, members of the team spent
                the day packing up the robot room for our move, discussing game
                strategies, and starting to build the ball and chain actuator
                for us to test on. We also agreed on a general plot structure

                At today’s meeting, we debated different mechanisms for our
                robot and analyzed the pros and cons of different drive systems.
                We needed a fast system that can be maneuvered easily and that
                can counteract pushing from external sources. We decided to use
                the H-Drive. We also discussed how we should tackle the arch
                actuator since we are concerned that a flipper mechanism will
                not be powerful enough to send the carriage all the way across.
                After classes ended, we went to the robot room and took apart
                last year’s robot and packed away all our tools and equipment
                since we are moving to another room in the school.

                During our lunch period, we all got together and put the
                exterior kiosk walls up. Then, we officially started the construction of the robot. After modelling the base on Autodesk and figuring out the dimensions needed, we started making the frame of the robot. After, we started planning how to properly fix the Banebot motors to the frame. We decided to make a lower base by having the middle of the wheels rest above the bottom of the frame. However, we encountered a problem with our mounts. The mounts that were made touch the ground before the wheel does so they will have to be modified so that the wheels touch the ground. Solutions we explored included rotating the mount so that the long part rests on the side instead of the bottom, redesigning and reprinting new mounts, and cutting the existing ones so that they are shorter than the wheels. After discussing, we decided to cut the mounts. We also decided to use different gearboxes for our motors will mount those as soon as they come.

              </h3>
              <p style="margin-top:0;">
                Today, three sub-teams were formed to make different versions of
                the linear system to hit the mushroom actuators. One of the systems relied on a telescoping mechanism that uses pulley and strings. A big issue encountered was the fact that the string kept slipping from the pulleys. Another problem with this design was that the system would push back in when it hits something. To solve this, we figured out that both ends of the pulley would have to be pulled to ensure that the tip of the system would not slide back in. The second system consisted of a rack and pinion mechanism where the rack would be made out of a PVC pipe with cut out grooves. After measuring and starting to cut the grooves of the PVC, we found VEX timing belts that matched the teeth of one of our gears. To save time, we decided to glue the belt to the PVC pipe instead of cutting grooves in. A problem with this when tested was that the PVC would rotate. We then attached that same belt to extrusion and the rotation problem was eliminated. The third team worked on a design that can be seen as a combination of the two others. It consists of a telescoping rack and pinion mechanism. Unfortunately that system did not go far in prototyping since we are waiting for the right parts to be shipped in January.  Some members on the team also worked on the base since new
                motor mounts had to be cut for the lower base design. The
                website team also worked on finalizing a new design involving a
                hidden Mari 51 website inside of a typical Marianopolis Robotics
                website. The video team also finished filming the first part of
                the video by completing the Naruto running training montage
                scene. Other than that, the kiosk team finished painting the
                walls and started to construct a new wall for the alien autopsy
                room.

              </h3>
              <p style="margin-top:0;">
                The day started off with some people working on planning out
                where our electronics and wires would go and mounting plexiglass
                to the frame appropriately. Others on the robot team divided
                into subteams and got started on different flipper designs.  For the first design, we did a CAD of a flipper design and then cut out a prototype out of wood. It resembled a circle with two extruding parts meant to hit the carriage of the arch. This design did not work since not enough vertical force was produced and the carriage was skipping and only displacing around 3 inches. We then tried replacing the piece with a rectangular block of wood rotation on one of its ends to mimic a baseball bat swinging. While this was better than the previous design, the carriage was still not being displaced enough.  This was because the block was sometimes not hitting the carriage in the right way. We then went back to the drawing board and tried to figure out a system best for producing the most amount of momentum. For this we need mass and speed. Our design was inspired by leg kicks: muscles contract and bottom of the leg rotates about the knee. We worked on two designs where a rope attached to the end of extrusion would spin around a motor until the rope would be tight and then once this would happen, the extrusion would snap and hit the carriage. The first design had the extrusion start on the same height as the carriage, and the other had the extrusion going downwards. We figured that the motor winding the string up would allow it to have the time to reach maximum speed. We did not test these designs yet but we will in January. Other than
                that, the kiosk team finished mounting the extra wall and
                started researching how to add wallpaper to the walls. At the
                end of the day, the team made a list of things to do during the
                work break as well as a list of things to purchase so that we
                have them in January.

                <p style="margin-top:0;">
                  Before the break, the design of the website was more or less figured out. The fake Marianopolis Robotics page was made but none of the other pages were made yet. The first thing that was done was a basic page design and layout that was responsive for any screen size. Once this was done, we copied this basic design to all the pages for the english side of the website. The files are saved on GitLab while Glitch was used to visualize the development of the website pages. Then, each page was made and the basic design was modified for each page. As we went along, images were edited on Photoshop and 3d models of the aliens were made on Blender. At first it was difficult to show the models on the website, but we eventually found a free online STL viewer (www.viewstl.com) that let us embed the model into the site. Another ongoing difficulty was properly formatting the website on mobile phones to have all the content present but still keep the website looking nice and not too cluttered. To do this, sometimes it was required to write brand new CSS for certain website pages, like the Employee Database page. By the end of the break, all the page designs were done and all there was left to do was to finish writing website content.

                  The kiosk will have a keycard scanner. The key card scanner that we built will use an Arduino with an RFID card detector. The sensor will detect the ID of the card and will display a greeting message corresponding to the user who scanned it. 2 LEDs are used to indicate if the door is “locked” or “unlocked”. The electronics will be placed into a 2 piece 3D printed enclosure. The reason for the enclosure to be printed in two pieces is to more easily have the mounting screws to the kiosk hidden. The front piece of the enclosure is held on with friction and/or magnets.

              <p style="margin-top:0;">
               Today was the first day back from the break. In the morning, the team split into multiple sub groups to work on different tasks during the day. The video team worked on starting to edit the first scenes and made a list of everything that needed to be fixed for potential reshoots. In the robot room, one group worked on prototyping a better version of the winding rope ‘leg’ mechanism to hit the carriage of the arch actuator. It was found out that winding the string around a wheel with a larger diameter created more of the desired snap than simply just winding the string around the motor, which was comparably slow. Another team worked on a new design during the break. It consists of a spring and cam system. The cam would push down on a piece, which would increase the elastic potential energy of the spring. When the cam rotates and releases the piece, the spring would extend and push up the piece, which would be rotating about a pivot point. This prototype still has to be tested with proper springs. Another group worked on a cleaner version of the telescoping linear system designed before the break. This one uses VEX parts and is therefore lighter, which ultimately helps the center of gravity. Another group worked on assembling the team’s new 3d printer and doing calibration tests. By the end of the day, they printed pieces for the linear system that were a better size for the pieces being used. Finally, the kiosk team worked on planning out where different parts of the kiosk would go and they installed the shelves for mounting the alien artefacts.

                Today, the kiosk team put up the wallpaper of our extra wall divide and got started on the build of the stasis tube. One of the robot teams that designed the cam and spring system yesterday 3d printed the cam and began tests with this. Another team finished the first prototype of the winding leg mechanism for the flipper. It worked so the proof of concepts was complete. That team began working on a modular mechanism that could be easily mounted to the robot. The team also began to work on planning the wiring of the robot and we installed temporary battery mounts to the robot. In the afternoon, we took team pictures and filmed some scenes for the video.

                By the end of the day, most of the frame of the stasis tube for the kiosk was built. We also decided that we wanted to bring forward the extra kiosk wall for the alien autopsy room so we had a team that worked on moving the wall. The kiosk team also put up the screen mounts. During the day, different robot subteams worked on various parts of the robot. One group worked on properly installing the fifth motor to the h-drive base. Another worked on calculating, measuring and cutting the pieces needed to make the system that will interact with the ball and chain actuator. Wiring was also worked on. The flipper leg mechanism was also worked on. Tests were done on where the string should pull happen to produce the most force. Also, we began to work on a structure that would prevent the string from tangling or getting caught in something. The video team refilmed the first couple scenes of the video due to an error found.

                Today was dedicated to moving forward on the projects started yesterday. The leg was completed and tested. However, it was very builty and took up a lot of space. The wiring of motor controllers was begun. The team also worked on solving the friction problem with the linear system by using grease and more tension. The kiosk team worked on the stasis tube and some people went to IKEA to get more shelves and a desk for the kiosk.

              <p style="margin-top:0;">
Evaluating what happened yesterday, we decided to redesign the leg to make it less bulky. This is an issue because we want the robot to be as light as it can be and we want the weight to be distributed. We worked on different ways to cover the wheel so that the string does not get caught on anything it should not get caught on. We also rethought our use of the linear system. A few people began working on an arm to drag the carriage across the arch should the flipper not work and realized that if the arm is extended, it can also hit the furthest mushroom actuator. Other than that, the wiring of the base drive motors was completed and the new gearboxes were properly put in place. The kiosk team continued to work on the robot and started thinking about props related to aliens for the competition. The website team also started finalizing page designs and translating pages to french.              </p>

Today, the arm was completed and all four of the limit switches were installed on it. The arm now has to be programmed. We also plan on adding a linear system that will help the arm push up to carry the carriage along the arch. Work was continued on the spinning wheel flipper redesign. A test was done for the spring and linear flipper mechanism but unfortunately it did not pass the proof of concept since the release was not powerful enough because of the gears. Another team started to work on an alternative flipper mechanism that resembles a crossbow. The kiosk team continued their work on the stasis tube and they cut out a window and painted the second extra wall of the kiosk.              </p>

We continued work on soldering the wires for the drive motors and motor controllers and an initial h-drive program was uploaded. We also programmed the arm using all four limit switches. Some modifications have to be made to the program and arm so that the arm does not slip and so that the limit switches always read the correct value. Work was also continued on the winding string flipper leg. We ran a tube through the wheel and supported it so that the string has a guide around the wheel and has less of a chance of getting tangled. We are still troubleshooting this but so far with the added tubes the string is tangling less. The video team filmed the game description scene and worked on editing different shots. The kiosk team completed the main build for the stasis tube. The website is almost complete and we had our first rounds of proofreadings and error checkings. At the end of the day some of us attended the CRC workshop on presentations.              <div class="images">

Today the kiosk team worked on painting the stasis tube and building our second extra wall with the window inside of it. The electrical team finished up the wiring and redid some connections for the drive base. The flipper team continued to work on ways to prevent the tangling of the string. We used chloroplast to hold in the string by making a ring around the wheel. This add on still has to be stress tested. The crossbow team continued their work on their mechanism. One problem that they ran into in the morning was that the vex motor was not strong enough to bring the spring down. However, we realized that because of the cooldown time of the arch actuator, we could play with gearing and just have the crossbow reload slower, but still in the downtime of the actuator. By the end of the day, the prototype seemed to be working. The team working on the arm started reinforcing it to make sure that it runs as smoothly as possible. The website team also continued work on the space invaders game for the website.

We continued to work on all the mechanisms. Wiring was complete and we tested the drive base. There is an issue with the middle wheel not always touching the ground and we are currently figuring out ways to bring it down. We also realized that not all of the drive motors are the same. After lunch, we mounted the arm and leg so that they can be present in the robot description scene of the video. Then, the video team filmed the last two scenes of the video and the rest of the group cleaned up our workspace. After that, our friends from Vanier came over to do a motor and gearbox exchange since we each had parts the other team needed. To finish off the day, we put up the final extra wall of the kiosk.<div class="images">

              Select a work phase to read in detail what the Marianopolis
              Robotics Team were working on during their 2019-20 season. The
              following web-logs document the recruitment of new members to the
              team all the way up to the last work day. They also explain and
              show the effort and time put into making their robot, kiosk,
              video, website, and tutorials.
